# Loan-Approval-Prediction-model

This project focuses on predicting whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant details such as income, credit history, and loan amount. The model is built using a Random Forest Classifier for better accuracy and robustness.

ðŸš€ **Features**

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)

Splits data into training & testing sets

Trains a Random Forest Classifier

Evaluates model performance using:

Accuracy

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

Confusion Matrix

Visualizes data distribution and model results

**ðŸ“Š Results**

Achieved an accuracy of ~XX% (varies based on dataset & preprocessing)

Balanced precision and recall for loan approval prediction

**ðŸ›  Tech Stack**

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Scikit-learn (Random Forest, preprocessing, evaluation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)

**ðŸ“‚ Dataset**

The dataset used is loan_prediction.csv, stored in Google Drive and loaded in Colab.
